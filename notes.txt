json.dump():

Imagine you have some data in your Python program, like a dictionary or a list.
Now, you want to save this data into a file on your computer.
json.dump() helps you do that. You give it your data (like a dictionary or a list) and tell it where to save it (the file).
It turns your data into a format that can be easily stored in a file (JSON format) and then writes it to the file.
After using json.dump(), you'll have your data saved in a file, ready to be used later.
json.load():

Now, let's say you saved some data in a file using json.dump() earlier.
Later, you want to use this data again in your Python program.
json.load() helps you with that. You tell it which file contains your saved data.
It reads the data from the file and turns it back into the original Python data format (like a dictionary or a list) that you can use in your program.
After using json.load(), you'll have your data back in your Python program, ready to be used just like before.
